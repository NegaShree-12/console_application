📌 ACTUAL COMPANY-STYLE QUESTION (Console Application)

Company: Zoho / Mr Cooper (Console-based round)

Problem Statement:

Build a Console Application to manage a Student Result Management System.

The application should:

Store student details

Accept marks for multiple subjects

Calculate total, average, and grade

Display student result summary

Constraints / Rules:

Use only core Java

No database, no files

Data should be stored using arrays

Input should be taken using Scanner

Follow Object-Oriented principles

🧠 HOW INTERVIEWERS EXPECT YOU TO PROCEED

They silently judge HOW you think, not just output.

Order they expect:

✅ Understand & clarify requirements

✅ Identify entities (classes)

✅ Decide variables & data types

✅ Design class diagram (mentally / on paper)

✅ Decide flow of execution

✅ Start coding

✅ STEP 1: UNDERSTAND & BREAK THE REQUIREMENTS
🔹 What YOU must do first (before touching code)

Take the problem and answer these questions clearly:

1️⃣ Identify INPUTS

What data is coming from the user?

Write this down:

Student ID

Student Name

Number of subjects

Marks for each subject

(Ask yourself: single student or multiple? — single student for now)

2️⃣ Identify PROCESSING

What calculations or logic are needed?

Calculate total marks

Calculate average

Assign grade

Avg ≥ 90 → A

Avg ≥ 75 → B

Avg ≥ 50 → C

Else → Fail

3️⃣ Identify OUTPUTS

What should be displayed on console?

Student ID

Student Name

Subject marks

Total

Average

Grade

4️⃣ Constraints Check (VERY IMPORTANT)

Confirm topics used are only from what you learned:

✔ Classes & Objects
✔ Constructors
✔ Arrays
✔ Scanner
✔ Methods
✔ Access modifiers
✔ this keyword
✔ Control statements

🚫 No collections
🚫 No file handling
🚫 No database

5️⃣ Final Understanding (You should be able to say this aloud)

“This is a console-based Java program where I store student details using arrays, compute total and average using methods, determine grade using if-else, and display the result.”

If you can say this confidently → you’re ready.

📝 YOUR TASK NOW (VERY IMPORTANT)
